# 💊 Hair Health Tracker

A beautiful, Apple-Health–inspired **Next.js 15** app that tracks your hair-care

statistics, and includes a private wellness tracker.

Everything runs **inside a single Next.js app** — Server Components, Server
Actions and Route Handlers. No Express, no separate backend. Deploys to the
**free Vercel Hobby plan** in minutes.

## 🚀 Quick start (local)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

The MongoDB connection string is set directly in
[`lib/db.ts`](lib/db.ts) — there are no `.env` files to configure.

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The four medications are inserted automatically on
first load if the collection is empty.

---

## 🍃 MongoDB Atlas setup

1. Create a free account at <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas> and a **free M0
   cluster**.
2. **Database Access** → *Add New Database User* → username + password (SCRAM).
3. **Network Access** → *Add IP Address* → **Allow access from anywhere**
   (`0.0.0.0/0`) so Vercel's serverless functions can connect.
4. **Connect → Drivers** → copy the connection string.
5. Set it as the `MONGODB_URI` constant in [`lib/db.ts`](lib/db.ts). Collections
   and indexes are created automatically.

## ✅ How completion works

- Every enabled medication defines one or more IST schedule times. The app
  materialises a **`DailyLog` row per dose per day** (`date + medicationName +
  scheduledTime`).
- You mark a dose done from the **Today timeline**, the **dashboard** or a
  **medication card** — the toggle flips `completed` / `completedAt` on that
  dose's `DailyLog` row.
- Streaks, the heatmap and per-medication stats are all derived from those
  per-dose completion rows, which is what makes twice-daily medications work
  correctly.

## ▲ Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. In Vercel, **Add New → Project** and import the repo.
3. **Deploy.** Open your deployment — medications seed on first load.

## 🗃️ Data model

```ts
Medication { name, description, instructions, scheduleTimes[], intervalDays, enabled, timestamps }
DailyLog   { date, medicationName, scheduledTime, completed, completedAt, notes, count }
```

`DailyLog` tracks completion **per dose** (`date + medicationName +
scheduledTime`), which is what makes twice-daily medications, the timeline and
streaks all work correctly. `intervalDays` lets a medication recur every N days
(1 = daily, 2 = every other day).

The **wellness tracker** shares the same `dailylogs` collection: it stores one
row per day identified by the reserved `medicationName`/`scheduledTime` sentinel
`__wellness__`, using the `count` and `notes` fields. Every medication query
excludes that sentinel, so wellness never counts as a dose.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The entire app operates on **Asia/Kolkata (IST, UTC+05:30)** regardless of
  where the server runs — schedule times, "today" and streaks are all IST.
- shadcn/ui components live in `components/ui` and are yours to customise.
- The wellness tracker stores data only in your own database — it is completely
  private to your deployment.
